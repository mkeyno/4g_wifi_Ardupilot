# ArduPilot Project
This project intends to port [ArduPilot](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot) firmware on new hardware base on embedded Linux multiple-core system and ESP32.
The main purpose of this project is to extend hardware abstract layer base on processing and task
## Project Motivation ##
This idea came to mind when I intent to add camera on Ardupilot hardware and establish the video link under 4G network. 
SimCom 7100 & 7600 were first choice as I was familiar with Arduino GPRS shield made of SimCom product and are cheap , 
however after digging around those product Iâ€™ve noticed  the only available firmware (AT Command) is not mature enough to add camera and work as slave supplementary hardware for Ardupilot master board .
Unfortunately [SimCom]() has not provided yet any open SDK for IoT developer , hence I look to the other 4G modules in market such as [Telit]( https://www.telit.com)  , [InnoCom]( https://www.innocomm.com), [Gemalto]( https://www.gemalto.com), [Multitech]( https://www.multitech.com/), [Sierra Wireless]( https://www.sierrawireless.com), [Quectel]( https://www.quectel.com)
I found [Airprime WPx5xx-76xx series](https://source.sierrawireless.com/devices/wp-series/wp7502/) very Promising and elegant. 
while Airprime series has powerful and rich hardware with multi core, it also  embedded with Linux and open source SDK  for IoT developer
